## Abstract

There has often been a standing debate on how transparency and perceived corruption of national leaders has affected oneâ€™s economy.  Traditional economic policy would suggest that free democratic and honest governments like those in North America and Western Europe would have the highest GDP per Captia, but in the past 40 years countries in the Middle East and Asia have witness rapid economic growth and corresponding dramatically increasing GDP per Captia authoritarian and opaque government finances.  Is it the case then still that in the 21st century that lower absence of corruption leads to higher GDP per Captia?
